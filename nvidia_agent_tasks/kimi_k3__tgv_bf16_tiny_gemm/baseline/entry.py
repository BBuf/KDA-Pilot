"""Baseline wrapper for `kimi_k3__tgv_bf16_tiny_gemm`.

The harness (`tools/bench_harness.py`) calls `OPS[<op>](**row_args)`. Each entry loads
the symbol from the installed SGLang and checks its source hash against the copy in this
directory, so a drifted environment is reported instead of silently benchmarked - see
`tools/baseline_loader.py`.

Write `solution/entry.py` with the same `OPS` keys to have the harness A/B it.
